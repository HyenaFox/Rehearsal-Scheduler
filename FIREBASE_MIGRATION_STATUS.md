# Firebase Migration Status Report

## ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Firebase Configuration
- **Firebase project configured** with Authentication and Firestore enabled
- **firebase.js config file** updated with real project credentials
- **Firebase SDK** ready to be installed (`npm install firebase`)

### 2. Firebase Storage Service
- **FirebaseStorageService.js** - Complete Firebase CRUD service created with methods for:
  - User authentication (signUp, signIn, signOut)
  - User management (getAllUsers, getUserById, updateUser, deleteUser)
  - User profiles (getUserProfile, updateUserProfile)
  - Rehearsals (CRUD operations + real-time subscriptions)
  - Scenes (CRUD operations + real-time subscriptions)
  - Timeslots (CRUD operations + real-time subscriptions)
  - Actors management

### 3. Authentication Context
- **AuthContext.tsx** - Completely rewritten to use Firebase Auth
  - Firebase auth state listener
  - Email/password and username login support
  - User registration with email validation
  - Real-time user data synchronization
  - Automatic admin user creation

### 4. Login Screen
- **FirebaseLoginScreen.tsx** - New login screen with:
  - Email/password authentication
  - Username-based login (finds email by username)
  - User registration flow
  - Default admin login option
  - Modern UI with loading states

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS / NEXT STEPS

### 1. Install Firebase Package
```bash
npm install firebase
```

### 2. Update Main App Entry Points
- Update `app/_layout.tsx` to use new AuthContext
- Update `app/index.js` to redirect to FirebaseLoginScreen when not authenticated
- Replace any references to old LoginScreen with FirebaseLoginScreen

### 3. Update All Components Using StorageService
Files that need to be updated to use FirebaseStorageService:

#### Priority 1 (Critical for basic functionality):
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Main dashboard
- `app/components/RehearsalsDisplay.js`
- `app/components/AddRehearsalModal.js`
- `app/screens/ScenesScreen.js`
- `app/screens/TimeslotsScreen.js`

#### Priority 2 (Feature components):
- `app/components/ActorEditModal.js`
- `app/components/SceneEditModal.js`
- `app/components/TimeslotEditModal.js`

### 4. Remove Legacy Files
After migration is complete, remove:
- `app/services/storage.js` (AsyncStorage-based)
- `app/services/hybridStorage.js` (transition helper)
- `app/screens/LoginScreen.tsx` (old version)
- `app/screens/ImprovedLoginScreen.tsx` (transition version)

### 5. Real-time Data Updates
Update components to use Firebase real-time subscriptions:
```javascript
// Example: Real-time rehearsals
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = FirebaseStorageService.subscribeToRehearsals((rehearsals) => {
    setRehearsals(rehearsals);
  });
  
  return unsubscribe;
}, []);
```

## 🎯 EXPECTED BENEFITS

### Immediate Benefits:
1. **Cloud Storage** - Data persists across devices and app reinstalls
2. **User Authentication** - Secure email/password based auth
3. **Multi-user Support** - Multiple users can have separate accounts
4. **Real-time Sync** - Changes sync instantly across all connected devices

### Long-term Benefits:
1. **Scalability** - Can handle unlimited users and data
2. **Backup & Recovery** - Google handles data backup automatically
3. **Offline Support** - Firestore provides offline caching
4. **Security** - Firebase handles security rules and user management

## 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

1. **Install Firebase:**
   ```bash
   npm install firebase
   ```

2. **Update app entry point** to use FirebaseLoginScreen when user is not authenticated

3. **Test basic login flow:**
   - Try "Default Admin Login" button
   - Or create new account with email/password

4. **Gradually migrate components** starting with the dashboard

5. **Test real-time sync** by opening the app on multiple devices/browsers

## 📝 TESTING CHECKLIST

### Authentication:
- [ ] Default admin login works
- [ ] New user registration works
- [ ] Email/password login works
- [ ] Username-based login works
- [ ] Logout works properly

### Data Operations:
- [ ] Create rehearsal saves to Firebase
- [ ] Edit rehearsal updates in Firebase
- [ ] Delete rehearsal removes from Firebase
- [ ] Real-time updates work across devices
- [ ] Same for Scenes and Timeslots

### User Management:
- [ ] User profiles save and load correctly
- [ ] Multiple users can have separate data
- [ ] Admin privileges work correctly

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues:
1. **Firebase not installed** - Run `npm install firebase`
2. **Network connectivity** - Ensure device has internet access
3. **Firebase rules** - Check Firestore security rules allow read/write
4. **Auth state** - Make sure user is authenticated before data operations

### Debug Tips:
1. Check browser console for Firebase errors
2. Monitor Firebase console for data changes
3. Use Firebase Auth console to see registered users
4. Test with Firebase emulator for local development
