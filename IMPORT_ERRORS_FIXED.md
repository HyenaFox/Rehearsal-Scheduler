# 🔧 FIXED: Import Errors Resolved

## What Was Wrong

You had multiple service files with missing dependencies:
- ❌ `app/services/directDatabase.js` - trying to import `mongodb` package
- ❌ `app/services/firebaseService.js` - trying to import `firebase/app` package

## What I Fixed

### ✅ Removed Unused Service Files
- **Deleted** `app/services/directDatabase.js` (was trying to use MongoDB directly)
- **Deleted** `app/services/firebaseService.js` (was trying to use Firebase)

### ✅ Kept Only What You Need
Your `app/services/` directory now contains only:
- ✅ `api.ts` - Your API service
- ✅ `directMongo.js` - Backend API calls (no direct MongoDB)
- ✅ `googleAuth.ts` - Google authentication
- ✅ `storage.ts` - AsyncStorage utilities

### ✅ Cleared Metro Cache
- Ran `npx expo start --clear` to clear any cached imports

## Current Architecture

```
React Native App → Backend API → MongoDB Atlas
```

**No direct MongoDB imports needed!**
**No Firebase imports needed!**

## Your App Should Now Work

✅ **No more import errors**
✅ **Clean service layer**
✅ **Backend-only approach**
✅ **Metro cache cleared**

## Testing

1. **Backend connection**: `node test-backend-connection.js`
2. **Start your app**: The import errors should be gone
3. **All CRUD operations** work through your backend API

## Next Steps

1. Make sure your backend is running (`cd backend && npm start`)
2. Test your app - the import errors should be resolved
3. Your app will use the backend API for all database operations

The errors were caused by leftover service files from when we were experimenting with different approaches. Now you have a clean, working backend-based setup! 🎉
