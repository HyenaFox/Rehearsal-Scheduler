# MongoDB Atlas Data API Setup Guide

## Problem
The native MongoDB client doesn't work in React Native/Expo web builds. We need to use MongoDB Atlas Data API instead.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Your Backend (Recommended for now)
Keep your existing backend but deploy it alongside the frontend. The backend handles MongoDB connections.

### Option 2: MongoDB Atlas Data API (Future)
Use MongoDB's HTTP-based Data API that works in browsers and React Native.

## Quick Fix: Re-enable Backend

Since the MongoDB client doesn't work in React Native, let's go back to using your backend API but deploy it properly:

1. **Update render.yaml** to include both frontend and backend
2. **Use your existing backend** for MongoDB operations
3. **Deploy both services** on Render.com

## Current Issue
The `mongodb` npm package is Node.js only and doesn't work in React Native/Expo environments.

## Recommended Approach
Let's use your existing backend API endpoints instead of trying to connect directly to MongoDB from the frontend.
