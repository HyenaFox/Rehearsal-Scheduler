# 🔧 DATABASE LOADING ISSUE DIAGNOSED

## ✅ **What We Found:**

### **MongoDB Connection: WORKING** ✅
- Your MongoDB Atlas connection string is valid
- Database connection is successful
- Collections exist in the database

### **Backend Server: NEEDS TO BE STARTED** ⚠️
- The backend server was not running
- This is why your app couldn't load data from the database
- Backend connects to MongoDB successfully when running

## 🚀 **How to Fix:**

### **1. Start Your Backend Server**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### **2. Verify Backend is Running**
You should see output like:
```
✅ Connected to MongoDB successfully
🚀 Server running on port 3000
```

### **3. Test Your App**
- With backend running, your React Native app should now load data
- All API endpoints (/api/scenes, /api/actors, etc.) will work
- The 404 errors will be gone

## 📋 **Full Development Workflow:**

### **Terminal 1: Backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### **Terminal 2: Frontend** 
```bash
npm start
```

### **Terminal 3: Testing (Optional)**
```bash
node test-backend-connection.js
```

## 🎯 **Why This Happened:**

1. **MongoDB is working fine** - connection string is valid
2. **Your backend code is correct** - models and routes are properly set up
3. **The issue was simple** - backend server wasn't running
4. **Frontend couldn't connect** - no server at localhost:3000

## ✅ **Expected Result:**

Once you start the backend server:
- ✅ Your app will load scenes, actors, rehearsals, and timeslots
- ✅ All CRUD operations will work
- ✅ No more 404 errors
- ✅ Database data will display properly

## 💡 **Pro Tip:**

Create a simple startup script to run both servers:
```bash
# In one terminal
cd backend && npm start

# In another terminal  
npm start
```

**The fix is simple: just start your backend server!** 🎉
