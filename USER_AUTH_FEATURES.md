## 🔄 **How It Works**

### 1. **First Time Setup**
```
User opens app → Login screen → Create account → Becomes admin
```

### 2. **Additional Users**
```
New user → Create account → Regular user privileges → Fill profile → Add to cast
```

### 3. **Daily Use**
```

```

## 🗄️ **Data Storage**

### **Separate Storage Layers:**
- **User accounts** - Stored in shared user list
- **Personal profiles** - Individual user profile files  
- **Cast list** - Actors actively involved in production
- **Rehearsals** - Shared rehearsal schedule

### **Privacy Model:**
- ✅ Users can only edit their own profiles
- ✅ Users can add/remove themselves from cast
- ✅ Admins can manage master cast list
- ✅ All users can view others' availability (for scheduling)

## 📱 **Cross-Platform Support**

All features work identically on **iOS** and **Android**:
- Authentication persists across platforms
- Profile data syncs through AsyncStorage
- UI adapts to platform conventions
- Auto-scheduler works with user data on both platforms

## 🚀 **Key Benefits**

1. **User Autonomy** - People manage their own availability
2. **Privacy** - No access to others' personal data
3. **Flexibility** - Join/leave cast as needed
4. **Smart Scheduling** - Auto-scheduler uses real user data
5. **Admin Control** - Production team can manage master list
6. **Scalable** - Easy to add new cast members

## 🎯 **Perfect for Theater Groups**

This system is ideal for:
- **Community theater** - Volunteer actors manage themselves
- **School productions** - Students set their own availability  
- **Professional theater** - Actors maintain their own profiles
- **Film/TV** - Cast members control their scheduling info

The app now provides a complete **user management system** while preserving all the original **auto-scheduling intelligence**! 🎭✨
