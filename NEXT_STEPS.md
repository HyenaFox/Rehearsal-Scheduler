# NEXT STEPS - What You Need to Do

## Summary

Your app is now configured to use MongoDB Realm Web SDK for direct database access without a backend server. Here's what you need to do:

## 1. Set Up MongoDB Realm App

**Follow the detailed guide in `MONGODB_REALM_SETUP.md`**

Quick steps:
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Find "App Services" in the left sidebar
3. Create a new app called `rehearsal-scheduler-app`
4. Enable Anonymous Authentication
5. Set up database rules for read/write access
6. Copy your App ID

## 2. Update Your Environment

Add your Realm App ID to `.env`:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_REALM_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
```

## 3. Test Everything

Run the test to make sure it works:
```bash
node test-direct-mongo.js
```

## 4. Deploy

When deploying to Render.com:
- Use the existing `render.yaml` (already configured for static site)
- Add environment variable: `EXPO_PUBLIC_REALM_APP_ID`

## 5. Clean Up (Optional)

After everything works, you can:
- Delete the `backend/` folder
- Remove backend-related files
- Keep only the React Native app

## Files Changed

- âœ… `app/services/directMongo.js` - Now uses Realm Web SDK
- âœ… `package.json` - Added `realm-web` dependency
- âœ… `render.yaml` - Configured for static deployment
- âœ… Documentation updated
